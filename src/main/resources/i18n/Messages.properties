documentGenerationSuccess = PDF document generated successfully!

argHTMLTemplate = A path to an HTML template to use for the PDF generation

argDynamicDataFile = Path to a file containing dynamic data to be inserted into the generated document

argOutputFilePath = Path to the generated PDF document, e.g. "/path/to/My-Document.pdf". If you specify a path to a directory (/path/to/dir), the generated document will be given the default name and will be placed in that directory, e.g. /path/to/dir/Document.pdf.

argLocale = Format dates and numbers in the generated document according to this argLocale. Examples of valid formats: "en", "en-US", "en-840".

argFont = Name and path to a custom font, surrounded by double quotes and separated by a space. The font's name has to match the one used in the template's CSS 'font-family' directive. E.g., if you have .some-element { font-family: 'MyCustomFont'; } in your template's styles, then you need to provide --font "MyCustomFont /path/to/custom-font.(ttf)|(otf)" in the command-line. You can specify multiple fonts by repeating this parameter. Another example - if you are using two different font families in your template (e.g. 'Regular' and 'Thick'), then you need to provide both of those like this: --font "Regular /path/to/regular-font.(ttf)|(otf)" --font "Thick /path/to/thick-font.(ttf)|(otf)".
